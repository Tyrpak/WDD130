        <p>My name is Balázs, and I'm from Hungary. I am living in the capitol, Budapest.</p>
        <p>You say "Balázs", like you say the "a" in "want" and the "ázs" is like the french "age" in for example "frommage". :)<br>UTF-8 is one of the greatest things for Hungarians, because you don't have to use "&#38;aacute" anymore.</p>
        <p>I'm 46 years old, I have made my first webpage in university, when rotating animated skulls and flames were the coolest things.</p>
        <p>I chose Web Programming, because I want to write my own webpages and code. Currenty I can only modify others code and play around with templates built by others. I have been stuck at the same intermediate level with webpage making for years.<br>My current job description is IT Support Helpdesk Agent. But I also never learned IT, I just live by my experiences as a user.<br>I would like to learn both and be better at them, to help others get their own websites and to help them with their IT problems.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are playing Warhammer 40k (tabletop game with miniature plastic models), sightseeing as a tourist and helping the missionaries learn Hungarian.</p>
        <p>I'm a fresh, new and enthusiastic member of the church for 3 years now. It has changed my life to the positive, and it keeps changing it, with every visit to the temple, with every institute class I take and with every question answered in prayer or in the general conference.</p>
